This croissant branding is peak mood — love the vibes 🥐🚀
Just joined the TG — excited to see where #CRSN goes on Solana!
The airdrop idea with IRL croissant selfies is genius lol
Who else thinks food coins are the next big memecoin wave?
Presale tiers look fair — curious what the launch LP will be
Locked 70% LP = nice. Team actually thought about launch mechanics
Love that there are no crazy promises — just community and memes
Anyone got the Solscan link? want to bookmark the contract
Croissant pfp incoming. This art direction slaps 🍞🔥
Phase 2 airdrop prompt is wholesome — gonna write my croissant love note
Solana + croissants = weirdly iconic. Count me in
Shoutout to the team for emphasizing anti-bot rules on airdrops
Hope the bakery (team) interacts a lot — community engagement is key
If launch has contests and pixel drops I’m all for it
That presale bonus at higher tiers? Tempting for long-term LP boost
Simple roadmap, doable goals — I like the focus on memes and raids
Anyone here baked their own croissant yet? IRL selfie incoming 😂
This is the kind of memecoin I can actually stans — playful not toxic
Bookmarking the presale page — will check dates on X & TG
Love a project that leans into fun instead of FOMO
Team wallet transparency is appreciated — nice to see addresses listed
Low drama, high vibes — the market needs more projects like this
Pixel drops? Sign me up for role farming
Can we get a croissant emoji role in TG? asking for a friend
The “no empty wallets” anti-bot rule will keep airdrops fair — good job
If anyone’s making croissant memes, drop them here — collab idea
Solid tokenomics for a memecoin — majority LP locked is reassuring
Curious about the collab plans in Week 3 — who are they targeting?
Taking notes for the IRL selfie — best croissant corner in town?
Quick question: will presale require Phantom or Backpack only?
The site copy is fun — feels like a real community project
Roadmap looks aggressive but doable — love the week-by-week layout
If there’s a launch raid I'll be there with memes and energy
This is a smart twist on memecoins — food > animals sometimes
Airdrop phase mechanic is creative — can’t wait to participate
Who’s making the first croissant GIF for the project? I volunteer
If the team does contests, I’m ready to design a croissant pixel art
Not financial advice, but this looks like a fun community to join
The “no promises” disclaimer is honest — that’s respectable
Saw the contract on the site — good to have it public. Let’s grow the bakery!
Community-first projects like this usually thrive — excited to be here
This feels early and organic — love joining before hype hits
Memes + food theme = the recipe for viral attention
Glad to see presale tiers that actually make sense
The croissant selfie task is too funny, I’m definitely doing it 😂
This might be the most delicious memecoin yet
The bakery vibe is wholesome — perfect for community growth
Love how transparent the tokenomics are
Croissant army forming strong already
This community feels like it’s going to be fun
Fair presale mechanics = more trust in the launch
Let’s see who makes the first viral croissant meme
I like how the roadmap keeps it realistic
Feels like a project built to last, not just hype
70% LP locked is bullish
Excited to see CRSN trend on Solana soon
The pixel art drops sound like a cool idea
Croissant memes about to flood X 😂
Feels good being early to this bakery
Excited for raids when presale closes
This branding is too clean for a meme project
Croissant gang is here to stay 🥐
The airdrop tasks are engaging, not boring — nice move
Team looks like they’re having fun, that’s a green flag
Already seeing croissant memes popping up, love it
Imagine croissant IRL meetups lol
Strong launch plan — weekly phases make sense
Presale with bonuses keeps it competitive
This token name just rolls off the tongue
Feels like a wholesome community brewing
Tokenomics actually look sustainable
I vibe with projects that don’t overpromise
Food coins about to take over memecoins
Excited to raid with #CroissantArmy
Memes + raids = unstoppable combo
Website design is clean and straight to the point
Happy to see team being upfront about everything
Croissant branding makes it instantly recognizable
The airdrop selfies will create real organic content
Can’t wait to farm roles in TG
This could easily become the next Solana meme trend
Community is already strong pre-launch
Feels like a fair chance for everyone to get in
No fake hype, just fun energy
I like the humor behind this project
Croissant memes are already making me laugh
I’ll definitely write why I love croissants for the airdrop
Roadmap with contests = community stays active
Feels like the bakery is just warming up
Croissant coin, simple but memorable
This is one of those memes that just works
